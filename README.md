--->Hi, I am Romanus. I am interested in tracking cosmic rays especially as it has to do with the Neutron monitors asymptotic cone of acceptance (direction of viewing) during Ground level enhancement of cosmic rays. I have just installed geant4-v11.0.2 in my Ubuntu 18:04 system. I would be pleased if I could get information on how to start since I am new in the use of GEANT4.
